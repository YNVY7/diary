    "text": "Personal Introduction\nMy name is Ella, I am from Buckinghamshire, just outside of London. I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Southampton , and studied a BA in Geography. During my time there I developed a particular interest in global health, maternal health and GIS, and I did my dissertation in mapping access to health care for pregnant women in Zambia. Currently, I am studying an MSc in Social and Geographic Data Science and I am planning to do my dissertation on a country in sub-Saharan Africa, looking at the relationship between long-term exposures to climate-related factors (such as extreme heat waves) during pregnancy on maternal health outcomes.\nOutside of academics, I really love art – I was president of Art Society back in Southampton last year! Here are some examples of paintings I have done:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI decided to study this master’s in order to advance my skills in geospatial analysis and to learn how to code as I am completely new to it! I have never studied remote sensing before so I am taking this course to learn about it and I hope to be able to use what I learn from this module to make use of remote sensing data in the future – and even for my dissertation!"

It is often used in tracking both natural and man-made changes such as forest fires and urban growth, and is frequently used in weather prediction through cloud tracking (USGS, 2023). The image below demonstrates the widespread applications of remote sensing.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Vasile, 2011)\n\n\n\n\nA specific example of an application of remote sensing is the use of it during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was used in different ways, such as to provide meteorological data to inform on disease transmission determinants, mapping ground features and activities to anticipate industry changes, job losses and food shortages, and how land use data could provide further insight into changing economic activities (Louw, et al., 2022). All of these uses helped to inform policy and have provided information into future mitigation strategies. Another example is that remotely sensed data was used to explain 62% of variations in wealth in a rural area in Kenya which contributed to evidence that satellite data could be used to predict poverty and to help with SDG goal monitoring (Watmough, et al., 2019)."

I did not realise how much it is used for, and it has inspired me to look into using it for my own research. It also made me look into certain data sources I have used before which I did not realise were created in part using remote sensing data. In particular, the data from WorldPop (one of the things I really liked about Southampton!), where they estimate populations by combining land cover, night time imagery and vegetation with other data and geospatial sources to produce a random forest regression tree model – really cool! I find it interesting how remotely sensed data can be manipulated to show different things and to highlight certain features of the land surface. In future I would like to use remotely sensed data in my dissertation, especially as it involves climate change where specific environmental factors will be included."

This application section will focus on studies which have made use of atmospheric corrections, as I found this type of correction really fascinating! I noticed that many papers mentioning atmospheric correction in their titles focused on ocean or water imagery. For example, Vanhellemont developed a dark spectrum fitting (DSF) correction model to estimate path reflectance in order to remove the effects of sun glinting (2019). This paper contributed to correction models to improve the quality of water imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\nHouston Harbour, Texas, with and without sun glint contamination (Vanhellemont, 2019)\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric correction is of particular importance in the ocean colour (OC) area of remote sensing, which is used to provide information on factors such as the abundance of chlorophyll as an indicator for plankton, seawater depth and seafloor reflectance (Ilori, et al., 2019).\nFrom understanding more about applications of atmospheric corrections in remote sensing, it is clear that a big challenge is to be able to make the corrections applicable to a time series and across different sensors and geographies – the same could be assumed for the other types of correction as well."

    "text": "3.3 Reflection\nI have to admit – this lecture was quite difficult for me to get my head around! Remote sensing imagery is more complex than I realised, however it is interesting to understand more about how the images can be manipulated to demonstrate particular things and how they can be improved to maximise their accuracy and potential. It is clear however, that there are so many ways the images can be enhanced, corrected or adjusted, that these changes must be carried out with a specific goal in mind. From the lecture and practical content found DOS correction particularly interesting - I think it is a clever and straightforward way to account for atmospheric corrections.\nI think understanding the theory behind correction is useful, however I am uncertain if it is important to understand the specific details and science behind each type as a lot of the data comes already corrected. That being said, I think it is valuable in data science and research to not accept data as it comes and just analyse it – it is important to think about how the data was created or adjusted before it is used. It's definitely something I will consider more in the future, whether using remotely sensed data or other types of data."

    "text": "8.2 Applications\nI found the heat vulnerability index really interesting so this application section focuses a lot on studies on this area. It is clear that the effects of UHI are widespread across different aspects of city life. I find the effect on health and wellbeing really interesting (as it is related to my dissertation in some ways, as mentioned in the reflection!). The UHI effects can exacerbate the effects of heatwaves, leaving specific at risk populations (such as older adults, young children, those who work outdoors and those in low income areas - especially due to issues with housing standards) more exposed (EPA, 2023). A study on Harare, Zimbabwe, highlighted how urbanisation can increase the UHI effect, and focused on heat vulnerability distribution for future policy planning (Mushore, et al., 2018). They used Lansat-8 multispectral imaging and found that 40% of the city suffered from high vulnerability, particularly amongst densely populated and low-income areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat vulnerability and land use and cover in Harare, Zimbabwe (Mushore, et al., 2018)\n\n\n\n\nAnother study looked at Hermosillo, Mexico, which experiences one of the highest number of heat related deaths in the country, and stated that the method used could be applied elsewhere and used by governments, particularly in regards to emergency preparedness (Navarro-Estupinan, et al., 2020).\nIt is clear that it is important in future studies to not only focus on the distribution of heat vulnerability alone, but also to look at exposures amongst different socioeconomic groups. It is also important to understand which groups and therefore individuals in the population may have a higher risk of adverse health effects from exposure to extreme heat. Further, policy must be targeted to areas which are experiencing more frequent and severe heatwaves."

My dissertation addresses climate change (including exposure to extreme heat such as heatwaves) during pregnancy on maternal health outcomes. I must admit, I had not actually thought about the heat in urban areas in the context of my dissertation as I was thinking more towards rural areas where physical access to healthcare is more of a barrier - however, I think investigating this issue within cities and understanding if the UHI effect is relevant would be really interesting.\nBased on the lecture and how the UHI is not explicitly mentioned in the SDGs, and from other modules and things I have noted, I feel that the SDGs must be adapted in future to have a sort of sub-section for cities and rural areas separately as I feel a lot of the targets are general and not necessarily adaptable to each area – in this way city specific frameworks could be focused on and UHI could be mitigated against more directly, offering a more focused global approach to it. In the future, I think it is important to try and fully understand the effects of different policies and if there are successful. As mentioned in the lecture – measures that work in one place may not work elsewhere – personally, I think this is really key in future work in this area as cities are structured entirely differently, with different building types and varying climates, amongst many other factors which could affect the UHI effect. Future frameworks could provide recommendations for specific city types or for sub-continental regions."

I did not realise how much it is used for, and it has inspired me to look into using it for my own research. It also made me look into certain data sources I have used before which I did not realise were created in part using remote sensing data. In particular, the data from WorldPop (one of the things I really liked about Southampton!), where they estimate populations by combining land cover, night time imagery and vegetation with other data and geospatial sources to produce a random forest regression tree model – really cool! I find it interesting how remotely sensed data can be manipulated to show different things and to highlight certain features of the land surface. In future I would like to use remotely sensed data in my dissertation, especially as it involves climate change where specific environmental factors will be included."

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nMy city of choice is Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Kinshasa is experiencing unprecedented population and urban growth, and, along with the effects of climate change, land use change as well as land degradation in the DRC as a whole, there is currently unsustainable urban growth in the city. Sustainable urban growth is needed to combat this issue. However, these problems must be understood and mapped first within the city.\nKinshasa is experiencing very high levels of population growth. It is a megacity with a population of 15 million, which is projected to increase to 27 million by 2035 (World Bank, 2021b). There are increasing effects of this. For example where population pressures are high in the city, service quality is very low, and water services especially are suffering. In terms of climate change, as the effects worsen, it is important for cities to become more resilient. Increased rainfall, disasters and adverse weather events are affecting crop yields and causing GDP loss.\nThe image below depicts the Kinshasa and Brazzaville area, which are neighbouring capital cities located along the banks of the Congo River. The Kinshasa metropolitan area is shown by the yellow box.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: NASA)\n\n\n\n\nKinshasa’s urban area has grown significantly in the last few decades which can be seen clearly in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n\nChinage in Kinshasa’s urban area over time (Source: Guerin, et al., 2013)\n\n\n\n\nThe DRC’s economy relies heavily on agriculture, for both the population’s income and food source. This is being jeopardized by urban growth and changing land use. Forest degradation is also becoming more and more of an issue. Land is being degraded further and pollution is increasing due to mining, especially cobalt mining. Decreasing soil quality means that many rural areas are being abandoned for the city which is further contributing to unsustainable urban growth and land pressure (Shapiro, et al., 2021).\nThis is representative of wider issues in cities across the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where population growth rates and urbanisation are high. Better tools are needed to understand the effects of these factors on issues such as food insecurity and service delivery. Additionally, more analysis is needed to understand where unsustainable urban development is occurring specifically in order to implement targeted sustainability policies to protect the environment and population in the future.\nIn 2021, the World Bank approved for $500 million to be used to support urban resilience and to expand services and opportunities in Kinshasa (World Bank, 2021a). The project is called Kin Eleda and aims to improve climate resilience and sustainable development through improved green spaces, reduced flood risk exposure and better water connections across the city, amongst other things. Implementing a policy to use remote sensing data to identify land use changes, urban growth, land degradation and climate change vulnerability can provide a useful tool to help to contribute to the Kin Eleda project’s goals.\nThis problem and addressing it directly also relates to the SDG targets including (UN, 2023):\n\n11.3 - inclusive urbanisation and sustainability in cities, of which a sub-target, 11.3.1, addresses land consumption to population growth as an indicator\n13.1 - resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters\n15.3 - restore degraded land, which includes indicator 15.3.1 - degraded land divided by total land area"

    "text": "5.2 Applications\nKey indicators of this problem which could be understood better are land degradation, land consumption rate including land cover change, and climate change. Adhikari, et al’s paper proposed indicators for sustainable city planning in Africa which have been successful in cities in other countries such as Burkina Faso, Kenya and Madagascar, and can be applied to Kinshasa (2022). The remotely sensed data needed would help to identify land consumption, climate change vulnerability and degraded land.\nClimate change:\n\nRisk classification and vulnerability assessment\nWith a loss of habitats, there is a higher risk of vulnerability\nAllows for the local government to implement specific and targeted policies\n\nLand degradation:\n\nSoil erosion will reduce agricultural productivity\nIncreasing deforestation and bad agricultural practices occurring in the city and around the country\nGEE and SEPAL - use 10m fine resolution data\nData needed may include indicators such as deforestation, conversion of cropland to settlements, conversion of grassland to cropland\n\nLand consumption rate:\n\nExpansion of urban areas versus population growth\nUrban growth using Sentinel-2 data, population growth from WorldPop data\nIncorporates land cover change\nLand is being converted at a fast rate for livestock uses and to account for population growth. Many farmers are moving to the city due to loss of agricultural work in rural areas\nThere is currently a model (GLOBIOM) which represents land use competition. It is being applied to the DRC (Mosnier, et al., 2016)\n\nThese uses of remote sensing data can provide insight into where sustainable management and conservation is needed in the city. It is important to address pressures of climate change, population growth and land use changes in the city to provide more sustainable plans and targeted interventions to those high risk areas. This is especially important in the context of Kinshasa’s very high population growth rate.\n\nMore integrated and targeted approach needed - sustainability at the heart of the approach and solution\nPrioritise areas for intervention - this will also help with urban planning and improved service delivery to these areas\nThe DRC has huge potential - it contains half of Africa’s forests, water resources, and has trillions of dollars of mineral resources - whilst the land degradation and other issues are alarming, reports argue that these changes are reversible (UNEP, 2017)\nIncorporating remote sensing into sustainable urban policy will also help with climate resilience and adaptation\n\nThere are some limitations and considerations which must be accounted for by city planners when addressing this issue:\n\nFunding limitations\nSkills needed\nWhere to start? A specific sub-focus needed first?\nEnsuring the city aligns with global policies"

    "text": "5.3 Reflections\nResearching this policy area in Kinshasa has been a big learning point for me in this module as it has highlighted how remote sensing data can be used to address multiple factors in a city for a common goal. Urban growth and change is complex and it is clear that it is rare than only one issue can be focused on at once since they are all interconnected. The climate change aspect of this policy is really interesting to me as it is linked to my dissertation and I think risk assessments and identifying vulnerable areas will become more popular in the future especially where it might not be possible to apply policies to large areas due to resource and funding limitations. Population growth in Kinshasa is also very interesting since it is happening at such a high rate. I would like to research further into this issue and understand more about the specific plans that the country has to mitigate the effects of this - I wonder that as it is known that the population will increase so much, if they will try and encourage people to move elsewhere, or if the focus will be on improving development and infrastructure within the city to account these projections."

This summary provides an overview of the lecture, classification, and the types of machine learning which were covered.\nHow is classified data used?\n\nClassification refers to categorising the pixels in imagery in order to label them such as with land cover use\nThere are different ways in which classification is carried out e.g. classification of urban green spaces\nOther uses of it include monitoring forests and illegal logging which includes pre-processing the data and carrying out resampling, DN to TOA conversion, quality assessment and normalisation, creating metrics, training data and adopting a decision tree approach - legal and illegal areas of deforestation can be identified\n\nHow is it classified? How can we extract land cover from EO data?\n\nExperts system = require human knowledge - how can a computer replicate this?\nMachine learning - classification and regression trees (CART)\nClassification trees = classify data into 2+ categories\nRegression trees = predict continuous dependent variables - subset the data into smaller chunks\n\nClassification and regression trees (CART)\n\nOption with the lowest impurity goes to the top of the tree and becomes the root (Gini impurity)\nRegression trees - where should the breaks in data be? - we can impose a minimum number of observations before splitting the data again using the sum of squared residuals\nA leaf with just one pixel may cause overfitting of data and poor performance of the model on unseen data\nOverfitting can be counteracted by establishing a minimun number of pixels in a leaf\nWeakest link pruning can also be used as a bottom-up approach\n\nRandom Forests\n\nMany classification decision trees\nDecision trees created from a random number of variables and a random subset\nBootstrapping = re-sampling by replacement data. The data not included in this (out of the bag, OOB) is tested and the tree with the most votes wins\n\nImage classification\n\nSupervised = classifier learns patterns to place labels onto new data\nUnsupervised = identify classes which are not previously known, computer clustering (k-means) and labelling\nMaximum likelihood = decision rule classifier, assigns the most probable land cover type and can use a threshold - prior probability information is required\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) = linear binary classifier, maximum margin between two classes with the support vectors being points on the boundaries, uses validation to understand levels of misclassifications, hard or soft margins can be implemented\nConsiderations - do we want to classify pixels or objects? Which machine learning model is best to use? Which hyperparameters are necessary to implement?"

The below image was created using a machine learning model in QGIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: MAPSCAPING, 2022)\n\n\n\n\nImage classification is also be used in military applications, however one limitation is that there is not necessarily a lot of labelled data available (Li, et al., 2017). In future however, this will undoubtedly increase and more labelled datasets will become widely available.\nA novel application of image classification was to detect floating plastic in coastal waterbodies, which used two supervised and two unsupervised models (including SVR and fuzzy c-means) (Basu, et al., 2021). The SVR produced an accuracy of over 95%.\nThis research can help to provide algorithms to implement policies to protect the environment and to target resources to the most affected areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid with and without plastic in locations in Greece and Cyprus (Source: Basu, et al., 2021)\n\n\n\n\nThere are really exciting applications of classifying remote sensing data which can help to contribute towards policy to achieve the SDGs and improve both environmental and social issues."

I had only come across machine learning for more tabular datasets such as with house price prediction, so it was interesting to learn about how it is applied to different data sources. I must admit that I do not find the details of the process behind machine learning that interesting, but I do appreciate that it is important to be able to understand data applications in more depth, and it has encouraged me to look more into the science behind different machine learning algorithms and how to choose which algorithm is used. This lecture reminded me of a news story I saw which I didn’t realise at the time was an example of machine learning for image classification - in France the government used remote sensing imagery to classify/identify pools in people’s gardens and cross-compared this with a list of who was paying tax for their pool in order to identify who wasn’t paying their tax or who didn’t have their pool registered with the tax office!"

Perhaps this is indicative of a need for more established and standardised models and algorithms which can be applied across different datasets and applications."
