# Personal Introduction {.unnumbered}

My name is Ella, I am from Buckinghamshire, just outside of London. I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Southampton , where I studied a BA in Geography. During my time there I developed a particular interest in global health, maternal health and GIS, and I did my dissertation in mapping access to health care for pregnant women in Zambia. Currently, I am studying an MSc in Social and Geographic Data Science and I am planning to do my dissertation on a country in sub-Saharan Africa, looking at the relationship between long-term exposures to climate-related factors (such as extreme heat waves) during pregnancy on maternal health outcomes.

Outside of academics, I really love art -- I was president of Art Society back in Southampton last year! Here are some examples of paintings I have done:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('myart.png')

```

I decided to study this master's in order to advance my skills in geospatial analysis and to learn how to code as I am completely new to it! I have never studied remote sensing before so I am taking this course to learn about it and I hope to be able to use what I learn from this module to make use of remote sensing data in the future -- and even for my dissertation!
