## Summary

What is GEE?

-   A platform which provides a catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial data for analysis.

-   Provides the ability to use large datasets at a very fast pace, applying self-written code.

-   Uses Javascript

-   Code runs on both the client and server side

Why is it used?

-   Complete image does not need to be loaded many times when looping

-   Public datasets, openly available use

Usage details

-   Image scale = pixel resolution, set by the output

-   All data converted automatically to the Mercator projection

-   Object = vector, raster, feature, string, number - belong to a class

-   Image = raster

-   Geometry = point, line, polygon - no attributes

-   Feature = geometry with attributes

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE, fig.cap="Google Earth Engine Code Editor interface (Source: Google Earth Engine"}
knitr::include_graphics('GEEinterface.png')

```

What can be done with GEE?

-   Spatial operations such as joins, zonal statistics ( reduceRegion() ) , filtering

-   Reducing imagery by region or neighbourhood

-   Machine learning, classification, deep learning

-   Imagery is accessible from multiple sensors

-   Linear regression, multivariate multiple linear regression

-   Joins - spatial joins, intersections\
